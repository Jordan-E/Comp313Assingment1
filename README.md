Game Description:
Main Action: The main action of my game is to navigate the player to the end post which is the winning condition of the game. While doing this the main character must avoid oncoming enemies which constantly follow you.
Hardest part of the game: The part of creating the game i found most difficult was the collision between the two sprites. This was difficult to work out how to set up collision and where it should be handled.
Most interesting part of the game: I personally like the movement in the game. To make the game a bit more complex i decided to add double jump to the main character after being inspired by Simons real life demonstration in a lecture.
